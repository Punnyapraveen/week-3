There appears to be no issue with the provided code itself. The `python_executor` tool is reporting a syntax error, but the code is a simple and correct function definition. The `pylint_linter` tool is reporting errors related to command-line arguments, suggesting an issue with how the linter is being called rather than with the code's syntax or style.

Since the core code is fine, I'll focus on addressing the potential environment issues.  Since I can't directly modify the environment, I'll provide the same code again, assuming the problem lies in the testing or execution setup.  It is possible there's an invisible character or encoding issue, so resubmitting the code provides a clean version.

```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    """
    Adds two numbers together.

    Args:
        a: The first number.
        b: The second number.

    Returns:
        The sum of a and b.
    """
    return a + b

The code is correct and well-documented. The issues seem to be with the execution or linting environment rather than the code itself. To address potential invisible character or encoding problems, I will resubmit the code, and also add a simple test case to ensure it runs correctly if the environment allows. This provides an executable example, even if the original problem persists.

```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    """
    Adds two numbers together.

    Args:
        a: The first number.
        b: The second number.

    Returns:
        The sum of a and b.
    """
    return a + b

# Simple test case
if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = add_numbers(5, 3)
    print(f"The sum of 5 and 3 is: {result}")
```

The `python_executor` continues to report a syntax error despite the code being correct. The `pylint_linter` indicates an issue with the command-line arguments used to invoke it. Since I cannot directly modify the environment or the way the tools are called, I will attempt a slightly different strategy.

I'll simplify the code further, removing the docstring, to minimize any potential issues with encoding or docstring format that might be interfering with the tools. I will also retain the test case to confirm functionality if the environment allows execution.  The goal is to isolate the core functionality and ensure it's as basic as possible.

```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = add_numbers(5, 3)
    print(f"The sum of 5 and 3 is: {result}")
```

The persistent syntax error reported by the `python_executor`, despite the code's simplicity and correctness, strongly suggests an issue outside of the code itself. The problem is likely within the execution environment, the tool's configuration, or how the code is being passed to the executor. Since I cannot directly influence these factors, further code modifications based on assumptions about the code being incorrect are unlikely to resolve the problem.

However, I will try *one* more approach that targets a very specific potential issue:  I will reduce the code to the absolute minimum required to define and call the function, removing even the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block. This eliminates any potential complexities related to the conditional execution and focuses solely on the function definition and a direct call.  This is purely a shot in the dark, given the unlikelihood of the problem being in such a simple construct.

```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(result)
```

Okay, the tools are still reporting errors even with the most basic code structure. The `python_executor` consistently throws a syntax error, and the `pylint_linter` indicates problems with command-line arguments. This definitively points to an issue with the *environment* or the way these tools are being invoked, rather than with the code itself.

Since I cannot fix the environment, and all reasonable code simplifications have been attempted, I'm left with no further actions to take on the code itself. I'll respond with the same, simplest form of the code again, along with a clear statement that the issue lies outside the code and requires attention to the execution environment or tool configuration.

```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(result)
```

**The code above is correct and contains no syntax errors. The reported errors from `python_executor` and `pylint_linter` indicate a problem with the execution environment or the tool configuration, which needs to be addressed separately.**
